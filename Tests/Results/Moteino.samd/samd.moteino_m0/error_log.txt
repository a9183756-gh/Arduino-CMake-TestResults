-- The CXX compiler identification is unknown
CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:3 (project):
  The CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER:

    /mnt/LIN_BUILD/src/Arduino-CMake-toolchain/Arduino-CMake-toolchain/Tests-build/build/Moteino.samd/_pkg_mgr/packages/arduino/tools/arm-none-eabi-gcc/7-2017q4/bin/arm-none-eabi-g++

  is not a full path to an existing compiler tool.

  Tell CMake where to find the compiler by setting either the environment
  variable "CXX" or the CMake cache entry CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER to the full path
  to the compiler, or to the compiler name if it is in the PATH.
